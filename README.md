# âš  This project is unmaintained

The game is constantly being updated, so this mod may break at some point. Being real I don't even like the game and with how much DMM is trying to geo-block it from everyone I just don't care. I will still look at PRs but if you want something that's in active development, check out https://github.com/phantasmx/BRSunTweaks
